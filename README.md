This application was developed as a pet of the project. The application itself is engaged in monitoring and filtering discussions of the social network Vkontakte. 
1) A single activity approach is used with the further use of fragments. 
2) The HTTP client is implemented using the Ktor framework. (Among other things, you can find a file to install a certificate for HTTPS). 
3) Uses Socket IO technology to start and stop monitoring. 
4) Date classes are used for json serialization. 
5) To download photos from the link, the Glide library is used. 
6) The application implements two-factor authentication.
7) Coroutines are used to perform blocking operations, and live data and observers are used to obtain data from them.
